# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added support for new head stroke type 27 (roofed narrow as in right-top corner of 乁).
- Added font parameter `kMinWidthU`, which controls the size of uroko (open end of horizontal stroke).

### Changed
- Changed tail width of `2:x:4` strokes where x ≥ 1000.

### Fixed
- Fixed the problem of top-left corner turning over under some conditions.
- Fixed routine of checking for crossing with otsu strokes.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-07-17
### Added
- Added `Buhin` to exported members of entry point.
- `Polygons` and `Buhin` are accessible as `Kage`'s static properties.
- The script for use in browser environment is now included in the tarball.

### Changed
- Font parameters are moved from `Kage` to `Kage.kFont`.
```diff
 const kage = new Kage();
-kage.kMinWidthY = 3;
-kage.kMinWidthT = 8;
+kage.kFont.kMinWidthY = 3;
+kage.kFont.kMinWidthT = 8;
 // ... the same goes for other parameters ...
```
- Assigning a value to `Kage.kShotai` now resets all font parameters to the default values. Set `Kage.kShotai` before modifying any font parameter.

### Deprecated
- Passing size as a parameter to `Kage` constructor is now deprecated. Use `Kage.kFont.setSize(size)` instead.
```diff
-const kage = new Kage(1);
+const kage = new Kage();
+kage.kFont.setSize(1);
```
